      The French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered
      road vehicle in 1769, while the Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz
      designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered automobile
      in 1808. The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday
      use—was invented in 1886, when the German inventor Carl Benz patented his
      Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars became widely available during the
      20th century. The 1901 Oldsmobile Curved Dash and the 1908 Ford Model T,
      both American cars, are widely considered the first mass-produced and
      mass-affordable cars, respectively. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US,
      where they replaced horse-drawn carriages In Europe and other parts of the
      world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.
      In the 21st century, car usage is still increasing rapidly, especially in
      China, India, and other newly industrialised countries. Cars have controls
      for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lamps. Over the
      decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles,
      making them progressively more complex. These include rear-reversing
      cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment.
      Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal
      combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric
      cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became
      commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy
      than petrol-driven cars before 2025. The transition from fossil
      fuel-powered cars to electric cars features prominently in most climate
      change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable
      solutions for climate change.
